- Reading binary data file "in.bin", and write to text file "q1out.txt"
- Counting component types in the circuit
number of batteries   = 2
number of resistors   = 4
number of captacitors = 2
number of inductors   = 1
- Listing component names of each type
BATTERIES  : U1 U3
RESISTORS  : U0 U2 U5 U7
INDUCTORS  : U4
CAPACITORS : U6 U8
